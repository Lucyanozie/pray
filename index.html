    <h1>If You Forget Me</h1>
    <img src="oneway/images/grow.jpg" width="300px" border="2">
    <p>If you forget me, do not look for me,<br>
    For I shall already have forgotten you.<br>
    If you think it long and mad,<br>
    The wind of banners that pass, from day to day<br>
    And turn into shadows.</p>

    <p>Remember the times that we have spent together,<br>
    Even if they are now gone like a withered rose,<br>
    With a touch of memory that lingers for a time,<br>
    Even if the rain had poured from the skies.</p>

    <p>Because I will not miss you,<br>
    But if you remember me, I will remain.<br>
    For I will always be your past.<br>
    It does not matter if you are far away.</p>

    <p>Just as <sub>H</sub>2O nourishes life, our memories nourish the soul.</p>

    <p>Like in chemistry, where <sup>2</sup> + <sub>3</sub> forms a stronger bond, so does love.</p>
